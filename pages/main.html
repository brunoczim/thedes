<p>
    Thedes implementation comes in two flavours (click to access docs):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="./native/">
            Native
        </a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="./wasm/">
            WASM
        </a>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    This is a platform divisions.
    Most of the API is common:
    if something is specific to native implementation,
    it will likely contain <code>native</code> in its path.
    The same goes for <code>wasm</code>.
